# This is the default hgkeeper access policy.  If you have not yet read
# README.md in this directory, please read it first.
#
# This file contains the access policies as well as groups for all access
# control via hgkeeper.
#
# The format of each policy is:
#
#   p, user/group, pathspec, permission, effect
#
# * p is required to define that this is a policy.
# * user/group is the name of the user or group that this policy is affecting.
# * pathspec is glob like pattern of repositories to affect.
# * permission is one of read, write, or init.  If a user has write access, they
#   also have read access.  Likewise, init access grants read and write access
#   as well.
# * effect is one of allow or deny.
#
# The first policy that matches will be honored, so you'll want your
# restrictive policies first and your permissive policies last.
# More than one policy can match, but if any of the matching policies is a deny,
# then the deny is honored and the user is denied permission.

# give users in the admins group the ability to create repositories everywhere.
# p, admins, /*, init, allow

# deny authenticated, but not explicitly defined users read access to the
# /hgkeeper repo
# p, public, /hgkeeper, read, deny

# finally allow all authenticated users to do anything
p, public, /*, init, allow
